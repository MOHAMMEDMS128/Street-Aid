# Street-Aid
Street Aid mobile app prototype is designed to benefit those who are homeless by providing them with a voice on the platform. Those who are homeless are often aren’t able to speak up for their selves in society, Street Aid tackles this problem by enabling a live chat feature in the application.
HTML5, PHP and MySQL were used to store the user’s data and validate them (local server) in order to redirect the user to his/her profile
page. Moreover, CSS3 was used to design HTML and PHP pages to make the app as
simple as possible for the user concerning the screen size of mobile devices.
